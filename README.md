# Console-Finances
Week 4 Challege for EdX Bootcamp

## Description:

This website is not super exciting, but the Javascript file includes a financial dataset stored in a 2D array. (Which arguably, is also not *super* exciting!) Below it is code that results in a full "Financial Analysis" being logged to the console.

## What I Did:

I struggled to understand the instructions for this challenge. Then I found the "hints" supremely useless. I spent hours and hours going down StackOverflow rabbit holes and trying to write long and difficult functions that partially solved my problems. But figured I must be over-complicating matters because we haven't even begun to cover functions in class. Finally I looped back-(see what I did there?)- and realised loops and if/else statements could solve the challenge.
